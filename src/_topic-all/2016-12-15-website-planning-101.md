<p>Launching a website, whether it’s an online store, a blog, or even a web app can be a daunting task. There’s so much that goes into planning, designing, and developing a site that a lot of people just simply overlook. My goal today will be to explain, as best I can, the multiple steps needed to get a website or web app off the ground, from conceptualizing and planning to launch.</p>

<p>Personally, I like to start all of my projects with an outline that lays out the ground work for my project. This way, I have everything documented and I’ll be able to reference it later if I get off track. The steps that we’ll discuss are planning and content, architecture, design, development and testing, marketing, tracking/maintenance and launch. I’d like to note that this is solely my view on planning a build; it’s completely up to you to use this as a template or update for your own personal use.</p>


<h3><strong>Planning and Content</strong></h3>
<p>The planning stage is probably one of the most important steps in launching a website or web app. It lays out the ground work for all of the other steps that follow. This is where I ask people to explain the goals or objectives they may have for their site. Is it an eCommerce site or blog? Is it informational or will it be social? What’s your audience? These questions will help guide you in the right direction to build the right site the first time. This phase will also give you a great opportunity to define the site content and any functionality/technologies you might want to integrate into it. There are a host of questions to ask before diving deeper into the build-out. So for example, does the project need a database? What frameworks should be integrated? It’s up to you, your company, and/or your contractor to sit down and ask these questions. In the long run, I believe it’s better to create an experience with your users; this will keep them engaged and have them coming back.
</p>

<h3><strong>Architecture</strong></h3>
<p>During this stage we need to layout out the content so it can be properly organized on the website. This is where we take inventory and define our site structure. Typically, this is where we would include the site design specs, site maps, outlines, wireframes, sketches, all technical requirements and support specs, and a schedule for completion. This will be your blueprint to your site or project.</p>


<h3><strong>Site Design</strong></h3>
<p>This phase is where we define how the site will look and feel. We’ll start by reviewing our wireframe and applying colors, images, styles and content. The goal is to produce all of the content components/functional programming and have them ready for the development stage. So, if you have any templates to your site or graphics this is where you want to incorporate them. This may also include prototyping which should incorporate pages to assess accurately what it’s like to use the site. This is usually a test to understand how the site will perform with users, helping you define any errors before we start the development.
The site design phase will give you a preview of your site before it launches. Giving you more control and peace of mind should there be any unexpected edits. Once this has passed approval you should create a style guide, however, that’s solely up to you and your team (I’d recommend it, though).</p>


<h3><strong>Site Development and Testing</strong></h3>
<p>This is where we dive deep and start coding our site. By approving the previous steps, we can finally start building our project. At this point, you should have a good grasp of how your site will come out and if you do not, I suggest that you review your plan and make any critiques now. Once we start development, it'll be hard to make major edits so I encourage you to review and make sure you’re ready. That being said, this is the stage where we build out our HTML pages, style them with CSS, and develop interactivity with JavaScript.</p>

<p>At this point, we’ll be able to see finished web pages with navigation, graphics, content etc. It’s vital that, at this stage, you start testing your site in browsers to identify and variances between browsers. No browser is created equal and it’s important to identify issues so that your users will have a smooth experience. Moreover, I’d like to point out that it’s very important that while coding your site that you maintain a clean and efficient code structure, so if a new developer comes along they’ll have an organized environment and not get lost in erroneous code. Lastly, during this phase, it’s important to have a development environment and a production/live environment. I won’t get into too much detail, but it basically gives you a back-up of your site and the ability to test any edits on your dev environment without creating any conflicts with your live site.</p>


<h3><strong>Site Marketing</strong></h3>
<p>This is where you would identify any and all marketing campaigns for your site. Basically, how are people going to know about your site. Just because it’s on the web doesn’t mean people will see it. This stage is where you would work on things like SEO, Google indexing, and Adwords among other strategies. I won’t go to deep into this subject as I feel I can (and will) create an entire blog post on this subject. If you have any specific questions on this subject, shoot me an email and I’ll be happy to help.</p>


<h3><strong>Tracking, Maintenance, and Launch</strong></h3>
<p>Now that your project is complete, how will understand you site activity? How would you know how many users came to your site? Well, there are free tools available to help you understand and engage your audience. Google Analytics is designed to produce traffic reports with graphics and charts to assist in data analysis. In addition to that there’s Google Tag Manager which can help you understand the various events that users do on your site. So for example, if you have YouTube videos on your site and you want to understand how many plays it’s gotten, GTM has the ability to help you track those types of interactions. There’s a lot more to go into but I’ll save that for another article.</p>

<p>As far as maintaining your site, just because it goes live doesn’t mean you should have a “set it and forget it” attitude. What if you have new content updates or have an updated logo? Or, what if something goes wrong in production? It’s important to set-up a schedule for maintaining and reviewing your site to verify that everything is working out as planned. Just work with your developer to set up something. Remember, your audience is always changing so keeping up with them will no doubt require some updates or maintenance to keep them engaged.</p>

<p>Finally, now that you’ve completed the entire process you’re ready to launch your new site. In terms of time, from planning to launch, it could take about 2.5 to 3 months minimum to build out a new site. It takes a lot of work but it pays off!
